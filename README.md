# clubhouse-desktop

This is an unofficial desktop client for the currently trending ClubHouse.

# Any bans on the accounts is possible so use it at your own risk!

Developed Using Electron JS + Vue JS + AgoraSDK.

For downloading the Mac/Linux/Windows compiled version go to the releases section:
https://github.com/callmearta/clubhouse-desktop/releases

I know the source code is a mess, but since it's been developed in a hurry (about 30-40hrs) to get it working and also since it was my first time using Electron, Vue, and Agora, I put my time into adding new features and improving stability instead of a clean code. So if you think it's a mess, feel free to make it clean and create a pull request.
Also I'm using a really old version of Agora web SDK and that's because the new version of Agora won't work due to the limitation they put on the user agents for clubhouse (at least I think so).
